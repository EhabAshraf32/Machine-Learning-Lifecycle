# Machine-Learning-Lifecycle
Machine learning lifecycle is a process that guides development and deployment of machine learning models in a structured way. It consists of various steps. Each step plays a crucial role in ensuring the success and effectiveness of the machine learning model. By following the machine learning lifecycle we can solve complex problems, can get data-driven insights and create scalable and sustainable models.

The steps are:
1- Problem Definition
2- Data Collection
3- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
4- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5- Feature Engineering and Selection
6- Model Selection
7- Model Training
8- Model Evaluation and Tuning
9- Model Deployment
10- Model Monitoring and Maintenance
